# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Twilio Sandbox Fix

## The Problem
Your bot is still showing `twilioSandboxCode: join your-sandbox-code` which means the environment variable is NOT set in Render.

## âœ… IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Get Your Real Sandbox Code
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/settings/whatsapp-sandbox
2. Look for: "Join your sandbox by sending: join <code>"
3. Copy the EXACT text (including "join ")

### Step 2: Add to Render (CRITICAL)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Click "Add Environment Variable"
5. Name: `TWILIO_SANDBOX_CODE`
6. Value: `join your-actual-code-here` (replace with your real code)
7. Click "Save Changes"
8. Wait for redeploy (2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify It's Fixed
Visit: https://padi-bot.onrender.com/debug
Should show: `"twilioSandboxCode": "join your-real-code"`

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Hardcode the Fix

If you can't set environment variables, I can hardcode your sandbox code directly in the code.

**Tell me your sandbox code and I'll fix it immediately!**

## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens After Fix

1. User sends message to bot
2. Bot detects sandbox error automatically
3. Bot sends detailed instructions with YOUR real sandbox code
4. User follows instructions
5. User can use the bot normally

## ðŸ“± Test Process

1. Add the environment variable
2. Wait for deployment
3. Send "hi" to +14155238886 from a number that hasn't joined sandbox
4. Bot should send proper instructions
5. Follow the instructions to join sandbox
6. Send "hi" again - should work!

**The issue is 100% the missing environment variable!**
