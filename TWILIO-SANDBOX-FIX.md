# 🔧 Twilio Sandbox Connection Fix

## 🚨 The Problem
Users are getting: **"your number whatsapp is not connected to sandbox"**

This happens when users haven't joined your Twilio WhatsApp sandbox yet.

## ✅ The Solution

### Step 1: Get Your Sandbox Code from Twilio Console

1. **Go to Twilio Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/settings/whatsapp-sandbox

2. **Find Your Sandbox Code:**
   - Look for: "Join your sandbox by sending: join <code>"
   - Example: "join abc-123-def"

3. **Copy the exact code** (including "join ")

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable to Render

1. **Go to Render Dashboard:**
   - Your service → Environment tab

2. **Add this environment variable:**
   ```
   TWILIO_SANDBOX_CODE=join your-actual-sandbox-code
   ```
   Replace `your-actual-sandbox-code` with the code from Step 1

3. **Save and redeploy**

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. **Check debug endpoint:**
   - Visit: https://padi-bot.onrender.com/debug
   - Should show: `"twilioSandboxCode": "join your-actual-sandbox-code"`

2. **Send a message to your bot:**
   - Send "hi" to +14155238886
   - If you get sandbox error, the bot will now send proper instructions

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Before (Broken):
- User gets sandbox error
- Bot sends generic message
- User doesn't know how to fix it

### After (Fixed):
- User gets sandbox error
- Bot detects the error automatically
- Bot sends detailed instructions with:
  - Link to Twilio console
  - Step-by-step process
  - Example of what to send
  - Clear next steps

## 📱 User Experience

When a user gets the sandbox error, they'll now receive:

```
❌ Twilio Sandbox Connection Required

Your WhatsApp number is not connected to our sandbox yet.

🔗 To connect your number:

1️⃣ Go to your Twilio Console:
   https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/settings/whatsapp-sandbox

2️⃣ Find your sandbox code (looks like: join <code>)

3️⃣ Send that exact message to +14155238886

4️⃣ Wait for confirmation from WhatsApp

5️⃣ Then come back and send any message to start using our bot

📱 Example: If your sandbox code is "join abc-123", send:
`join abc-123`

💡 After connecting, you can:

- `❌ Failed to send sandbox instructions:` - Error sending instructions

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add the environment variable** to Render
2. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes)
3. **Test with a new number** that hasn't joined sandbox
4. **Verify the instructions** are clear and helpful

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Always use the exact sandbox code** from your Twilio console
- **Test with a fresh number** to see the full flow
